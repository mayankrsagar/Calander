# Calendar App

## Overview

This is a simple calendar application built with Next.js, React, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. Users can view a month-by-month calendar, add, edit, and delete events on any date, and persist events locally using `localStorage`.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mayankrsagar/Calander
   cd Calendar
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Open** your browser at `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Bonus Features Implemented

* **LocalStorage Persistence**: Events are saved to and loaded from `localStorage`, so data remains across sessions.
* **Responsive Design**: Uses Tailwind CSS to ensure the calendar looks good on mobile and desktop.

## Time Taken

Approximately **6 hours** to implement core features, Redux integration, styling, and persistence.
